I wasn't completely satisfied with the existing open source image viewer applications for Linux. So, I thought, "Why not create my own solution?".
My goal was to develop an application that is keyboard-friendly, optimized for speed with GPU support, and capable of intelligently pre-loading images into memory as I navigate through them.
So I assembled [igl](https://github.com/gmagno/igl).
